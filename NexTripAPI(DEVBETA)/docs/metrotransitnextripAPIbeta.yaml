    ## MetroTransit NexTrip API (BETA)

    ***

      - Currently this API permits 2 requests per minute for anonymous API clients 
      - In a future release this API will offer rate limits for OAuth clients
      - OAuth 2.0 AccessCode Tokens Scopes 
      
          - routes:all                  Grants read access to all routes
          - routes:express              Grants read access to only express routes
          - routes:local                Grants read access to local routes

      # GET /NexTrip/{ROUTE}/{DIRECTION}/{STOP}

      - GET TIMEPOINT DEPARTURES
      - To make a valid request specify the integer values of the Route ID, Direction, and the Bus Stop ID as path parameters
      - Without an Accept Header the default response schema is XML, for JSON set the Accept header to application/json 
      
      # GET /NexTrip/{STOPID}
      
      - GET DEPARTURES
      - This operation is used to return a list of departures scheduled for any given bus stop. 
      - A StopID is an integer value identifying any one of the many thousands of bus stops in the metro. 
      - Stop information can be derived from the GTFS schedule data updated weekly for public use. 
      - datafinder.org/metadata/transit_schedule_google_feed.html

      # GET /NexTrip/Directions/{ROUTE}

      - GET DIRECTIONS
      - Returns the two directions that are valid for a given route. Either North/South or East/West. 
      - The result includes text/value pair with the direction name and an ID. 
      - Directions are identified with an ID value. 1 = South, 2 = East, 3 = West, 4 = North. 

      # GET /NexTrip/Providers

      - GET PROVIDERS
      - Returns a list of area Transit providers. 
      - Providers are identified in the list of Routes allowing routes to be selected for a single provider. 

      # GET /NexTrip/Routes

      - GET ROUTES 
      - Returns a list of Transit routes that are in service on the current day.

      # GET /NexTrip/Stops/{ROUTE}/{DIRECTION}

      - GET STOPS
      - Returns a list of Timepoint stops for the given Route/Direction. 
      - The result includes text/value pairs with the stop description and a 4 character stop (or node) identifier. 

      # GET /NexTrip/VehicleLocations/{ROUTE}

      - GET VEHICLE LOCATIONS
      - This operation returns a list of vehicles currently in service that have recently (within 5 minutes) 
      - reported their locations. A route paramter is used to return results for the given route. 
      - Use "0" for the route parameter to return a list of all vehicles in service.

      # POST /NexTrip/update/Routes (Future API Enhancement)
      

      - This API operation requires an admin_AccessCode Token with one of the following scopes 
      
          - admin_updateroutes

      - The POST message body must be a properly formatted JSON object with the following fields 

          ```
          
                {
                  "Route":"integerRouteID", 
                  "ProviderID":"integerProviderID", 
                  "duration":"integerMinutes", 
                  "stops":[{"Text":"stringStopName", "Value":"stringStopID"},{"Text":"stringStopName", "Value":"stringStopID"}]
                  "numberofstops":"integerStops", 
                  "express":"True or False", 
                  "Description":"Details about the route"
                }
